          Hello! My name is Lisa and I am a developer who specializes in the front
          end of development and I love to make designs come alive, interactive,
          responsive and user friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strive to be minimalistic and simple. And I apply this to my life,
          my code, and my design. My coding motto is all about Keeping it Stupid Simple,
          Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself, modularization, and consistency. I like shiny new things
          and am constantly learning to keep up with the ever changing technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not coding, learning, and breaking things, I like to play League
          of Legends and bake.
        </p>
