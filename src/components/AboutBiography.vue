        Hi, my name is Lisa, and I am a developer who specializes in the front
        end of development. I love to make designs come alive, interactive,
        responsive and user friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I strive to be minimalistic and simple. And I apply this to my life,
        my code, and my design. My coding motto is all about Keeping it Stupid Simple,
        Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself, modularization, and consistency. I like shiny new things
        and am constantly learning to keep up with the ever changing technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I am not coding, learning, and breaking things, I like to play League
        of Legends and bake.
